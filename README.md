# Get Action Dump

## How to use
Go onto Node Beta (or any other development node) and run `/actiondump [colours]` \(\[colours\] replaces the colours with & codes.\)  
There also is `/reportkeepalives <on|off>`, which doing the above command might work better after it reports a keepAlive. However doing /actiondump immediately on join might be better then that.

The info is put into the `.minecraft/getactiondump`.
Running the actiondump command is buggy, but doesn't do anything if dumpactioninfo like messages aren't seen.
