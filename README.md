# Get Action Dump
Used for getting updated versions of ActionDump, this took too long to make.

## How to use
Download the mod ffs, it requires Fabric API

### Getting ActionDump
I connect to df with an alternate IP (**54.39.130.89**) since it seemed to disconnect me less.  
Go into chat and run `/dumpactioninfo [-c]` (-c uses & codes)  
Wait for it to complete. There are roughly **90902 lines** and it takes me ***95 seconds*** to complete. This may change based of your internet  

Once this is complete, you will be disconnected and sent to a custom menu.  
It has three options:  
**Main Menu**: Sends you to the Main Menu.  
**Copy Data**: Copies the data exported to the actiondump (or error data if it's an error screen)  
**Copy Path**: Copies the path in which getactiondump uses.  

The info is put into the `.minecraft/getactiondump`.  
The database is put into `db.json`.
