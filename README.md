# Get Action Dump
This took too long to make.

## How to use

I connect to df with an alternate IP (**54.39.130.89**) since it seemed to diconnect me less.  
Go onto Node Beta (or any other development node) and run `/actiondump [colours]` \(\[colours\] replaces the colours with & codes.\)  
Wait for it to complete. There are roughly **87180 lines** and it takes me ***77 seconds*** to complete.  

## After complete

Once it is complete, you will be disconnected and sent to a custom menu.  
It has three options:  
**Main Menu**: Sends you to the Main Menu.  
**Copy Data**: Copies the data exported to the actiondump (or error data if it's an error screen)  
**Copy Path**: Copies the path in which getactiondump uses.  

The info is put into the `.minecraft/getactiondump`.  
The database is put into `db.json`.
